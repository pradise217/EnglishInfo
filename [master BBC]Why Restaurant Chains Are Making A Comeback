    (00:00) Mcdonald's is rolling out a special $5 value menu next month. Wendy's and Burger King both launch $5 value meals of their own. Restaurants are hoping to win back customers who have been turned off by high prices and turn to grocery stores for meals. Why are people going back to Chili's all of a sudden? I
    (00:14) don't get it. This is called the Triple Dipper. Chili's estimates that nearly 40% of its growth this past quarter came from these mozzarella sticks going viral on TikTok. You cannot tell me that's the most insane cheese pull you've ever seen. Across fast food chains, chicken has been a hit, especially this year.
    (00:34) What began as a buffalo chicken wing restaurant in 1994, in Texas, has now grown to more than 2,000 restaurants nationwide. The company says that this growth was driven by increased transactions. I would say depending on the day, we will receive typically around 300, 400 transactions. We weren't always the top of
    (00:55) the tier. And over the last two years we've just seen such a turnaround. Why are people going back to Chili's all of a sudden? I don't get it. Chili's Grill & Bar is an anomaly in the restaurant space right now. Can I get a thousand islands please? Yes . At locations that have been open for more than a year,
    (01:30) Chili's fourth quarter sales increased nearly 15% compared to the same time period in 2023. In a segment that is seen declining traffic and flat sales is a tremendous accomplishment, and I think it speaks to how much what they did really resonates with today's consumer. Chili's parent company, Brinker International,
    (01:54) reported its total revenue surpassing $4.4 billion in fiscal 2024. That's an all time high for the company. Well, the brand has experienced some internet virality over the past few months, its current success, didn't happen overnight. It's actually been at this turnaround for now, it's a little over two
    (02:11) years, and we just started with the fundamentals of casual dining. So that sounds easy. It sounds kind of a little bit of motherhood and apple pie. But the reality is it's really, really difficult to execute. So how did Chili's do it, and can they keep it up? Brinker International owns Chili's and Maggiano's
    (02:37) Little Italy. Chili's accounts for more than 85% of its business. Its growth was pioneered by the founder of casual dining, Norman Brinker, who acquired the chain in 1983. There is a long term history with Chili's that goes back to the Norman Brinker days. A lot of pride in having fun at the restaurant operations
    (02:58) led culture, who was very much a youthful brand that was differentiated from grill and bar peers. The chain grew quickly, reaching a peak store count of over 1,300 U.S . locations by 2008, and Brinker International's annual revenue had exceeded $4 billion. The recession hit the restaurant sector hard,
    (03:16) especially casual dining, as consumers increasingly opted to eat meals at home. Chili's, has shut down stores almost every year since. That brand slowly lost its way, often pursuing things that were outside the brand parameters. Extending the menu too far for example. Why did you feel the need to narrow the offerings of it?
    (03:38) Yeah, you know, I think in legacy brands, it typically, the way to try to get short term sales growth is you add more items, and that will work in the short term, but it makes it very difficult for the restaurant teams to be able to execute, unless the business is growing fast enough where they can afford more labor,
    (03:52) it's very hard to run that menu. And so that's what we had. Guys have a start out to 84. It would make our lives difficult on a Friday, Saturday night when we're really busy and each zone in the kitchen is trying to pump out food as fast as possible and try to make a quality dish. And sometimes that quality suffered.
    (04:11) There was also a misguided focus placed on takeout and delivery. After falling from its highs in 2007, Brinker's revenue remained relatively stagnant in the decade leading up to the pandemic. Even the three years preceding Covid, the profitability of the business had gotten worse, partly because they were
    (04:28) pursuing off premise businesses. Ultimately, they took the money out of the advertising budget and put it into third party delivery initiatives and even virtual brands to reach the consumer with the kitchens and the assets that they had. Well those initiatives, hurt the on premise business. That all changed when CEO
    (04:49) Kevin Hochman stepped in, in 2022. Brinker International's 2024 revenue surpassed the highs it saw in the early 2000s. What's changed, why are Americans going back to Chili's? What's happening is one, the actual experience is a whole lot better. But then two, you know, our marketing team has done a great job of
    (05:12) getting back into the called the zeitgeist or being relevant again. We weren't always the top of the tier, and over the last two years we've just seen such a turnaround. You know, from the support we get from, you know, our bosses to the technology, the culinary innovations, all of those things. It made Chili's fun
    (05:33) again. Over the past two fiscal years, Chili's has grown its average sales per restaurant by about $440,000. That's 14% more than what it was before, in the same time period, Hochman says the menu has shrunk more than 20%. And typically you don't get rid of menu items because you're going to lose sales.
    (05:52) We got rid of almost a quarter of our menu, right? And I'm happy to say that that simplification has worked. We have grown the business, we have improved guest metrics. And that's why we're beating the industry pretty significantly right now. In the 2024 fiscal year, Brinker International has invested $200 million in
    (06:07) capital expenditure. That means it was investing heavily in repairs, maintenance, and improving its restaurants overall. Brinker International share price is up around 60% since the start of 2024. But despite strong sales, the company did miss Wall Street's expectations for earnings in its most recent
    (06:25) quarter. We went and put more labor into the restaurants, which is expensive. We accelerated facility improvements that we probably would have done next year, and we'll pull them into this year. Wall Street didn't anticipate us making those additional investments to try to hold on to more of that traffic.
    (06:39) And that was the change in expectations versus what they were seeing, and what we knew. Traffic spiked by about 6% in Chili's most recent quarter compared to the same time period of last year. Hey, yo, Chili's, what? Part of that is due to due to recent success with social media. You hear 5% traffic growth
    (06:56) and you're like, is that that much? Well, it doesn't happen throughout the day. It happens during peak times. So, that could be, you know, in some cases it could be 20, 30% more guests coming in, right? And then spread across the day, it's 5%. So, you really got to staff up. If you don't want lines and you want to have a
    (07:09) good experience. To keep up, Brinker has spent an additional $5 million on staffing. Another 15 to $20 million of labor is planned for 2025. This is called the Triple Dipper, Chili's estimates that nearly 40% of its growth this past quarter came from these mozzarella sticks going viral on TikTok. You cannot tell me that's
    (07:31) the most insane cheese pull you've ever seen. Every time a customer orders that, I'm like, oh, you saw it on TikTok, and they're like, yeah, it's hilarious. Within a week, you know what we were ordering in order to fulfill those orders tripled in some restaurants, even probably even more so. We were, we were bringing in so
    (07:50) many mozzarella planks that, you know, it was hard to store them all, but you didn't have to because they were going out just as quickly as they were coming in. The chain estimates that the other 60% of sales growth came from its $10.99 Big Smasher meal, meaning it's capitalizing on one of the most important consumer pain
    (08:07) points at the current time: value. The inflation rate of limited service dining, think food you order at the counter, has outpaced that of sit down restaurants for all of 2023 and even the first quarter of 2024. And Chili's saw an opportunity precisely there. How is this Chili's three for me only $10.99,
    (08:33) when fast food is so expensive? It could be because we don't have to pay for any mascots. Please. Certainly, they've had decent success over the last couple of years, but this really now has resonated with consumers in a way that I haven't seen a full service promotion resonate in quite some time. We're a nostalgic brand that
    (08:56) brings people in, and they've leaned into that and they've leaned into the socials, they've leaned into the advertising, and their innovations, their investments are working and our traffic is up. Our sales are up. Brinker spent $14 million more on advertising in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the same
    (09:15) time last year. Applebee's has pushed a similar strategy, but with less success. Its same -store sales have been in the negative every quarter over the past year, while Chili's have been in the positive. You order DoorDash nowadays or you know, delivery, and you might pay $17, $18 for a value meal of
    (09:35) sorts from a fast food place, and you're not getting a fraction of what we're offering with Chili's. As casual dining is marketing itself as an alternative to fast food. Even CEO of Darden Restaurants, which owns chains like Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, said certain casual dining chains are taking customers
    (09:54) from fast food competitors. Still, though, from a consumer spending perspective, over the past decade, limited-service spending has increased as a percentage of overall sales, while full-service dining has decreased. Limited-service, which includes fast food, and fast casual, i.e. upscale fast food.
    (10:13) A little bit higher experience, but we bucket it all together in limited-service has outperformed. Traffic has been good. It's slowed as everything else has. Fast food chains are more exposed to the lower income consumer, who have pulled back with certain discretionary spending. Casual dining has more of a
    (10:32) percentage of consumers that are over $100,000 in income. And that exposure, that relative exposure, has been good for them if they have the right value. However, when comparing a chain like Chili's to McDonald's, the scale of the companies must be put into context. Last year, Chile's revenue was around
    (10:49) $3.5 billion, while McDonald's revenue was over $25 billion. Double digit sales growth is simply much harder to come by when you're that big. Plus, the reality is that consumers who frequent fast food chains versus casual dining chains are often coming from different income levels. Because the interest rates
    (11:08) are higher, the wealth effects are less. The long term real wage declines all hurt the under $50,000 cohort. And unfortunately for McDonald's, for example, they have to deal with that way more than Chili's. In addition to the fact that Chili's has played much better in the value realm, and in fact, quite astutely,
    (11:32) Kevin Hochman and team have marketed to that relative value even versus fast food. The real test for Chili's will be sustaining this recent growth for the long haul. Customers need to not only be coming back, but they need to be spending more, too. Full service is not only the traffic conundrum getting
    (11:51) people in the seats, but also then generating margin, and a lot of the higher margin items that are generated by casual dining - alcohol, desserts, appetizers have been the areas that consumers have cut back on. That's important because restaurants often rely on deals to bring people in the door and get them spending
    (12:09) on other things. Value offerings themselves typically aren't generating high margins. At what point does that eat into profit, though? Are you concerned about that as a maybe long term... Well, certainly you have to be concerned with that, because ultimately we have shareholders and we have a great rate of return. You
    (12:29) know, one of the things I'm proud of that the team has been able to do is we have what's called a barbell strategy. So as long as we have items that we can that we can offer for guests that want something a little bit more versus some guests that just want a high price point, and we keep that that mix in balance,
    (12:42) right? We're going to continue to grow profitability. What would you like today, Ryan? So I'll do a split combo. Would you like- 6, 8, 10 or 12? 8, s ounds great. What began as a buffalo chicken wing restaurant in 1994, in Texas, has now grown to more than 2,000 restaurants nationwide. Right now, we're just
    (13:13) dropping some chicken. I love this, out of any other flavor, hot honey. Oh, man, I'll take it. I'll take hot honey more than anything, ever. Mhm. That's the lemon pepper. It's one of their most popular. It's delicious. Since initially going public in 2015, Wingstop stock price is up over 1,100%. Over the past five years,
    (13:35) it's up nearly 300%. And in the past year alone, it's more than doubled. So Wingstop's growth is really unprecedented in the restaurant industry. You know, if I went back to Chipotle in the 2000s, when the brand was emerging, we saw growth almost at Chipotle at Wingstop's levels. But what's different
    (13:52) about Wingstop, is the fact that it's over 2,000 stores. There's no other brand at scale to the growth that Wingstop's doing. The company's systemwide store count reached over 2,300 at the end of June. That's about 1,000 more locations than it had in 2019. Consequently, revenue has more than doubled in that same time
    (14:11) period. On average, our franchisees invest about $500,000 to open a Wingstop, and they're basically getting that entire investment paid back to them in less than two years because the income statement is so strong. With chains like Starbucks and McDonald's facing consumer pullback. How did Wingstop become one
    (14:32) of the hottest restaurant chains in the country? Across fast food chains, chicken has been a hit, especially this year. And with school coming back around, football scaling back up, it's starting to pick up in the morning. They love chicken in the morning. They love chicken in the morning. I love chicken. But
    (14:54) you know, I love chicken in the morning. That's good news for Wingstop, because well, chicken is about all it sells. Its menu also lends itself well to an experiential offering for hanging out with friends or watching a football game. If you're thinking about someone who has to make a decision on where to trim
    (15:13) spending, the likelihood that they're going to give up something that is associated with a social event is much lower than, hey, I'm going to forego my Starbucks coffee this morning. Wingstop is a special occasion. Our frequency over my ten years has really averaged about three times a quarter or once a month,
    (15:34) a low frequency occasion. And we're just now, for the first time, starting to see that tick upwards, which we're pretty excited about. Going beyond just wings has helped drive that uptick. The chicken sandwich wars took off right before the pandemic and as chain after chain vied for market share. Wingstop eventually got in
    (15:53) on the game. The chicken sandwich this was introduced in the middle of 2022. Chicken is a very popular protein with the consumer, particularly fried chicken. And so the ability for Wingstop to offer their chicken sandwich in 11 flavors, you know, really an opportunity for continued utilization . Wingstop has seen an
    (16:13) increase in new guests visiting its locations ever since the chicken sandwich was introduced. And those new customers are visiting more frequently than its traditional wing customer. The company reported same store sales growth, increasing nearly 30% in the U.S . for the second quarter of this year. That means
    (16:28) that the company generated more sales per store compared to last year. The company says that this growth was driven by increased transactions. I would say depending on the day, we will receive typically around 300, 400 transactions. Investors look at same store sales is the key metric for health of restaurant
    (16:48) concept. Wingstop has experienced same-store sales growth for 20 years. The stores themselves require relatively low operational costs. We run a very efficient labor profile. You can run that Wingstop, that's doing on average $2 million. You can run that with as few as four team members in the restaurant. We run in a very
    (17:10) efficient box-on-average about 1,600, 1,700 square feet. And so our occupancy cost where we target B, B- real estate is extremely efficient. So this Wingstop in Neptune, New Jersey opened a few years back. And I initially thought it was a very interesting location choice. It's set off from the main road, across from a grocery
    (17:30) store in the middle of a shopping center. But that's exactly the type of real estate that Wingstop targets. It doesn't need to target prime real estate because last quarter, nearly 70% of its sales came from digital orders, meaning people were not just impulsively stopping by, they were coming here intentionally.
    (17:49) The use occasion or the consumption occasion for Wingstop is the consumer coming to them. And so I don't care if I have to go next to the pet store to pick up my wings, because I'm going there to pick it up. Whereas, like I said, if a McDonald's was in the middle of a strip mall, you lose a lot of those impulse
    (18:09) purchases because it's, you know, there's not a drive-thru. Brand awareness is growing. Franchisees contribute a percentage of sales into the national advertising fund. So as system sales grow, so does ad spend, which nearly doubled from 2021 to 2023. From about five years ago to now. Not a lot of people
    (18:28) know about Wingstop. But not everybody knows about Wingstop. The viral nature of the brand and how it's cropped up so many different times on social media has really helped feed into the, you know, the customer acquisition. H ashtag Wingstop has been tagged in over 150,000 TikTok videos that have garnered millions
    (18:49) of views. The company has leaned heavily into marketing with live sports. It has official partnerships with multiple NBA teams, and its free wing promotions have led to viral moments, with top athletes. Giannis wants the chance to get the QR code to get his free wings. Although the chain saw its U.S. same store sales grow
    (19:10) over 28% last quarter, and beat Wall Street earnings expectations, the stock price has actually fallen more than 10% from the highs that were seen in June. Wingstop is still one of the best performing restaurant stocks. I think as of recent, you've seen a big divergence in the valuations of restaurant stocks.
    (19:31) So, a stock like Wingstop, a stock like Sweetgreen, a stock like Cava, have very premium valuations relative to the overall restaurant space and then other more mature restaurant stocks like McDonald's, like Starbucks, have seen their stocks have their valuation beat down. Take a look at Wingstop stock price. Now look at the
    (19:57) company's earnings per share over the last 12 months. That price to earnings ratio is high. Now take a look at the same valuation, for stocks like McDonald's and Starbucks. Trading at a higher premium, means more volatility in its share price. The rest of the story, though, is really macro, that the consumer base for
    (20:20) Wingstop historically skewed more lower income and on a price per calorie basis. It's just cheaper to go to a quick service drive-thru to get food, relative to a Wingstop. However, Charles says that Wingstop is seeing a shift from a middle to higher income consumer with increased transaction on third party delivery apps.
    (20:38) Plus, unlike its fast food competitors, Wingstop has kept a tight leash on prices. Since 2019, Wingstop has only increased prices by around 15%, while its peers and the quick-service restaurant category fall into the 30 to 40% range. The reason we think quick -service is underperforming Wingstop, is really about
    (20:58) the amount of price that quick -service has taken, and that there is a lot less discipline relative to what Wingstop has done in recent years. In 2021, wing prices soared, so Wingstop pushed chicken thighs instead. To combat this type of volatility going forward, the company changed the way it sourced
    (21:15) its chicken wings. They shifted from a spot where they're just buying whatever the market price is, to negotiating that price for the whole bird. They'll use the parts of the bird they need for their operation, the wing, the breast, etc. and they'll effectively sell the remains to either a soup or pet food company that can
    (21:33) use the remaining part of the bird. And that's allowing us to create predictability. And most importantly, it's minimizing the volatility that our franchisees see on their income statement within their food cost line. In its most recent earnings call, Wingstop raised its store count goal to reach a domestic total of 6,000
    (21:56) locations. That would be about triple its current total and more locations than Kentucky Fried Chicken currently has in the U.S. However, that kind of growth could be a long way out. TD Cowen anticipates the chain to have about 4,000 locations domestically, and 5,000 locations globally, by 2030. You know, I don't think this
    (22:15) is going to be the new Kentucky Fried Chicken or some big chain, but they've got another 2 or 3 years of packing on 250, 300 stores before they start saturating America. The company also says it has room for growth within the world of third party delivery systems. On DoorDash and on Uber Eats, our awareness levels
    (22:34) are still really low. Our delivery channel mix is about 30% today. When we benchmark delivery channel mix to other, more mature, heavy off premise businesses. Think big pizza. Their delivery channel mix is north of 50%, so we see a lot of runway there. Wingstop is still relatively low awareness, even as the broader consumer
    (23:01) is maybe pulling back from spending on food away from home, Wingstop has the opportunity to gain incremental consumers that have never heard of the brand before. Skipworth says that Wingstop has a goal of transitioning entirely to digital ordering. Does that mean, like you would eliminate that face-to-face interaction?
    (23:20) And it would be more of just kind of a pickup model, is that the goal? We're not holding chicken that's been previously cooked. We're making it to order. And on average it takes about 18 minutes to get your order at a Wingstop. So, training guests to order ahead, through our digital platform. It's actually just
    (23:38) a better guest experience. But then for our perspective, we tend to see a higher average check. The average annual sales per store is over $2 million, and the company now aims to make that $3 million. About 98% of Wingstop's are franchises. And as we grow our average sales-per-restaurant, it's continuing to make
    (24:01) those income statements for our franchisees better. And that's going to make them want to open more Wingstops. And that's how I think we'll continue to be able to scale Wingstop into what our overall vision is, is to become a top ten global restaurant brand. In order to be a top ten restaurant brand, you're
    (24:19) talking about roughly about $10 billion in scale. And so this is an ambition that getting to $18 billion based on their long term targets, will put themselves pretty solidly there. And just to give you some you some perspective, the $18 billion target puts them right now in between Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell,
    (24:36) in terms of what that would mean for today. With fast food customers revolting over higher prices, chains like McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's are bringing back the value meal. Consumers are continuing to collide with companies over higher prices. Mcdonald's is rolling out a special $5 value menu next
    (25:07) month. Wendy's and Burger King both launch $5 value meals of their own. Restaurants are hoping to win back customers, who have been turned off by high prices and turned to grocery stores for meals. Mcdonald's, Taco Bell, Burger King and Wendy's have unveiled or revived meal deals with a $5 or less price tag.
    (25:22) Find out which extra value meal is $2.99. Go to your local McDonald's. It's a familiar playbook that fast food chains have used in the past, and the competition has sparked what some are calling the value menu war. Causing this, you know. quote, "war," could actually be helpful for them, and it might actually help
    (25:37) the entire fast food industry. And this has always been an industry where value is critically important. We stepped away from that or backed away from that a little bit during the pandemic and in the years subsequent, because spending was robust, because there was a lot of inflation in the commodity complex.
    (25:53) But now, you know, we're seeing what I would characterize as a little bit more of a return to normal. So what has led to the revival of the value menu, and are lower prices here to stay? With the price of fast food skyrocketing, cash strapped consumers have pulled back on their restaurant spend. You go back to where we were
    (26:16) in 2019, our costs in the U.S . have gone up 40%, in our restaurants. Since '19? Since 2019, costs are up 40%, and- Prices are, and prices are up? Pricing, pricing is up correspondingly. As of August 2024, prices for food away from home rose over 27% since 2019. In the U.S., McDonald's same-store sales
    (26:38) fell 0.7% in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the previous year, the first time domestic same-store sales have fallen since 2020. Other chains felt the same pressures in the U.S . In the second quarter of 2024, Burger King saw same-store sales decline by 0.1%, and KFC's fell 5% compared to the previous
    (26:57) year. Higher wages have also been a factor. Labor costs in states like California and New York further pinched tight margins. Well, I would consider the $5 menu sort of chapter one of a multi chapter value playbook that we're going to be writing. And that is continued through the end of August. Mcdonald's has said it's
    (27:17) seeing traffic increase as a result, and investors are buying in. The company's stock has been moving up since reporting earnings in late July. Taco Bell led the value menu wars launching its cravings menu back in January. Value is working for them, but it's really, again, to quote McDonald's, "it's a
    (27:34) knife fight out there." The value meals are only an entry point to customers to return, and potentially buy more items not found on the discounted menu. Fast food typically does better during economic downturns, but the sharp increase in prices over the years have made fast food meals a luxury. But value menus can
    (27:50) be tough on franchisees, because simply lowering the prices will equate to less profit. A McDonald's franchisees advocacy group wrote in a letter obtained by CNBC to the chain, saying, "the fact remains that in order to provide the consumer with more affordable options, they must be affordable to the owner/operators."
    (28:08) The discount pricing may be a boon for customers, but not so much for franchisees. Franchisees tried to push back against the value menu rollout, citing reduced costs would further hurt their already tight profit margins. Well, you know, McDonald's is a big family and it has been around for 60 years,
    (28:23) it's been, it's prided itself its success on this three-legged stool between suppliers, the brand, and of course, the vital franchisees. And so in every big family, you have disagreements. But this debate, this internal debate, has yielded a great result for the brand. And that is us being in the forefront of value.
    (28:41) Franchisees have recognized the fact that they voted to continue it, is recognized that the vast majority of franchisees can make money on these meal bundles, and in particular, are seeing incremental transactions, incremental sales from that. In addition, they're looking at other value constructs that are being more of a
    (28:59) permanent solution. So, there's a lot of gates to go through here. So whether it's buy one, get one for a dollar, or for five, they need to find a value solution here in the near term. Mcdonald's originally announced its value menu would be seasonal, lasting only a month. It later decided to extend the deals.
    (29:17) Analysts in the street alike expect these deals to remain in some form far longer, to continue to attract the value driven consumer. We are working with the franchisees in the U.S . to get a broader value construct in place. And so what we're working on right now with the franchisees is, what's next? I consider the
    (29:33) $5 meal a bridge value program, and then what we'll be doing is putting in place a more permanent value program, much like we had previously. Some restaurant analysts expect the value menus to slowly disappear as they normally do, but in their place will remain meal deals like Wendy's popular for for
    (29:50) four or Taco Bell's Cravings box. You know, it's just going to be a consistent battle for market share. I wouldn't expect dramatic changes in results from Q2 to Q3 just given the demand environment. And so what we're really going to be looking for is which restaurants, which companies can resonate most with,
    (30:08) with consumers and therefore outpace the rest of the industry.

How did the same-store sales performance of Chili's and Applebee's differ over the past year, despite both seemingly employing similar strategies?
According to the transcript, how is the casual dining sector presenting itself in comparison to the fast food industry?

✅ 정답 (Answers)

Key elements that helped Chili's regain relevance included support from bosses, technology improvements, and culinary innovations, which collectively made Chili's fun again.
Chili's menu shrunk by more than 20%, and surprisingly, this simplification led to business growth and improved guest metrics.
In the 2024 fiscal year, Brinker International invested $200 million in capital expenditure, focusing on repairs, maintenance, and overall improvements to their restaurants.
Brinker International's earnings missed Wall Street's expectations because they made additional investments in labor and accelerated facility improvements, which Wall Street did not anticipate.
Chili's traffic spiked by about 6% in its most recent quarter compared to the same time last year, and this is significant because it occurred during peak times, potentially representing a much larger increase in guests at those hours.
The Triple Dipper, specifically the mozzarella sticks, contributed to nearly 40% of Chili's growth in the past quarter, and TikTok played a key role in making it go viral.
The other 60% of Chili's sales growth came from its $10.99 Big Smasher meal, capitalizing on the consumer pain point of value in the current economic climate.
The transcript suggests that Chili's $10.99 "three for me" deal offers better value than fast food because fast food has become very expensive, and Chili's offers more for a comparable price, possibly because they don't have to pay for mascots.
Over the past year, Chili's same-store sales have been positive each quarter, while Applebee's same-store sales have been negative each quarter.
The casual dining sector is marketing itself as an alternative to fast food, emphasizing that consumers can get significantly more for their money compared to the value meals offered by fast food chains.
